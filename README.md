# HMM-POS-Tagger
Hidden Markov Model Part of Speech Tagger For Any Natural Language ( like English, Chinese ). The training data provided are 
tokenized and tagged; the testing data are expected to be tokenized, and tagger will add the tags.

Two programs: hmmlearn.py will learn a hidden Markov model from the training data, and hmmdecode.py will use the model to tag new data.
